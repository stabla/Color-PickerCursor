# Color-PickerCursor
Move your cursor and pick a color. (or not, but it's fun).

## Why?
I was getting bored in my little corner.

## Demo
[How it's looks like](https://stabla.github.io/Color-PickerCursor/)

## About
Move on three axis : X, Y, and Scroll (Yeah, I know, it's Y too, but scroll is a new dimension there).

  Moving on X axis set the Red color.<br>
  Moving on Y axis set the Green color.<br>
  Moving on Scroll axis set the Blue color.<br>



Get the value of your action on input if you want. You can as well set a value and see it.

That's all.
